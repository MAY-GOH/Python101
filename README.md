# Python101
Purposely create this file for Software dev subject

For my students: *Suggestion: Use your own laptop during practical classes to familiar yourself with the software on your own device
<br>
Before practical 1, 
1. Please download 
Anaconda Distribution - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/getting-started
You will be using IDLE, Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Prompt

2. Familiar yourself with google colab - https://colab.research.google.com

3. Another IDE for coding, optional, however highly suggested by me: Visual Studio Code
